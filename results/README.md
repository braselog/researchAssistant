# Results

This directory contains outputs from the analysis pipeline.

## Purpose

Store all pipeline outputs here, including:

- **Intermediate results**: Outputs from each pipeline stage
- **Final results**: Summary statistics, tables, processed datasets
- **Metrics**: Model performance metrics (JSON/YAML files)
- **Logs**: Execution logs from pipeline runs

## Organization

```
results/
├── intermediate/          # Outputs from intermediate pipeline stages
│   ├── preprocessed/      # From preprocessing stage
│   ├── features/          # From feature engineering
│   └── models/            # Trained models
├── final/                 # Final analysis outputs
│   ├── tables/            # Summary tables (CSV, Excel)
│   ├── statistics/        # Statistical test results

├── metrics/               # Pipeline metrics (DVC tracked)

│   └── eval_metrics.json
└── logs/                  # Execution logs
    └── pipeline_runs/
```

## DVC Tracking

Results are tracked by DVC to ensure reproducibility:

```yaml
# In dvc.yaml, reference outputs like:
stages:
  train:
    cmd: python pipeline/scripts/train.py
    outs:
      - results/intermediate/models/model.pkl
    metrics:
      - results/metrics/train_metrics.json:
          cache: false
```

## Important Notes

1. **Don't edit manually**: Results should only be generated by pipeline scripts
2. **Use DVC to track**: Large files should be tracked with `dvc add`
3. **Metrics are special**: Use `metrics:` in dvc.yaml for comparison across runs
4. **Gitignore large files**: The `.gitignore` excludes large binary files; use DVC

## Accessing Results

```bash
# Reproduce all results
dvc repro

# Pull results from remote storage
dvc pull

# Compare metrics across experiments
dvc metrics show
dvc metrics diff
```

## Figures vs Results

- **Figures** (`manuscript/figures/`): Publication-ready visualizations with captions
- **Results** (this directory): Raw outputs, metrics, intermediate data

If a result becomes a figure, generate it in `manuscript/figures/` with an accompanying caption.
