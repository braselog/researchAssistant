# /write_results Command

> Draft the results section from figures and their captions.
> Builds a coherent narrative from visual evidence.

## When to Use
- Figures exist in `manuscript/figures/`
- Figure captions are drafted
- Methods section is complete
- Ready to tell the story of your findings

## Prerequisites
- At least one figure with caption in `manuscript/figures/figN/`
- Methods section reflects the analysis that generated figures
- Project aims defined (to structure narrative around)

## Execution Steps

### 1. Gather Context

Read these files:
- `.research/project_telos.md` - Aims to structure narrative
- `manuscript/methods.md` - What analyses were done
- `manuscript/figures/*/caption.md` - All figure captions
- `manuscript/figures/*/*.png|.pdf|.svg` - Figures themselves
- `manuscript/results.md` - Existing draft (if any)

### 2. Figure-First Approach

Results should be organized around figures, not chronologically. 

**Map figures to aims:**

```markdown
| Figure | Aim Addressed | Key Finding |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Fig 1 | Aim 1 | [Main takeaway] |
| Fig 2 | Aim 1 | [Supports/extends Fig 1] |
| Fig 3 | Aim 2 | [Different aspect] |
```

### 3. Results Section Structure

```markdown
# Results

## [Thematic heading tied to Aim 1]
<!-- 1-3 paragraphs covering related figures -->

[Introductory sentence connecting to methods/aims]
[Main finding with quantitative support]
[Reference to figure: (Figure 1A)]
[Additional details or subfindings]
[Brief interpretation only - save discussion for Discussion]

## [Thematic heading tied to Aim 2]
<!-- Continue pattern -->

## [Additional sections as needed]
```

### 4. Writing Standards for Results

**Figure-to-Text Relationship:**

| In Figure | In Text |
|-----------|---------|
| Visual pattern | Quantitative description |
| Data points | Statistical summary |
| Comparisons shown | Effect sizes, p-values |
| Trends | Direction and magnitude |

**DO:**
- Lead with the finding, not the method
- Include key numbers (means, SDs, p-values, effect sizes)
- Reference specific figure panels (Figure 1A, 1B)
- Use past tense (these are your results)
- One major finding per paragraph

**DON'T:**
- Interpret or speculate (save for Discussion)
- Include methods details (already in Methods)
- Describe every data point visible in figures
- Use phrases like "It can be seen that..."
- Repeat figure captions verbatim

### 5. Statistical Reporting Standards

**Descriptive Statistics by Data Type:**

| Data Distribution | Report |
|-------------------|--------|
| Normal/Symmetric | Mean ± SD |
| Skewed | Median (IQR or range) |
| Categorical | n (%) |

**Always include:**
- Sample sizes (N or n)
- Central tendency (mean, median)
- Variability (SD, SE, IQR, CI)
- Test statistic (t, F, χ², r, etc.)
- Degrees of freedom where applicable
- P-value (exact or threshold)
- Effect size (Cohen's d, η², r², etc.)

**Formatting examples:**
```
"Significant increase in expression (mean ± SD: 2.3 ± 0.4 vs 1.1 ± 0.3; t(28) = 5.2, p < 0.001, d = 1.8)"

"Strong positive correlation (r = 0.72, 95% CI [0.58, 0.82], p < 0.001)"

"Model accuracy was 87% (95% CI [83%, 91%]; AUC = 0.92)"
```

**P-Value Formatting:**
```
✅ Correct formats:
- P = 0.042 (exact value)
- P < 0.001 (when very small)
- P = 0.12 (non-significant, still report exact)

❌ Incorrect formats:
- P < 0.05 (vague, unless truly < 0.001)
- P = NS or P = n.s. (always give exact value)
- P = 0.0000001 (excessive precision)
```

**Effect Size Benchmarks:**

| Measure | Small | Medium | Large |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Cohen's d (mean diff) | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| r (correlation) | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.5 |
| η² (ANOVA) | 0.01 | 0.06 | 0.14 |
| Odds Ratio | 1.5 | 2.5 | 4.0 |

**Significant Figures:**
- Use 2 significant digits for most statistics
- Match precision to measurement precision
- Be consistent throughout

**Tables vs Figures Decision:**

| Use Tables When... | Use Figures When... |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Exact values are important | Patterns/trends matter |
| Comparing many groups | Showing relationships |
| Precise numbers needed | Visual impact needed |
| Complex, multidimensional data | Simple comparisons |

### 6. Generate Results Draft

```markdown
# Results

<!-- 
Draft generated by Research Assistant on [DATE]
Based on figures in: manuscript/figures/
Aims from: .research/project_telos.md

⚠️ VERIFY:
- All statistics are accurate
- Figure references are correct
- Nothing is interpreted (save for Discussion)
-->

## [Heading for Aim 1: e.g., "Gene expression patterns differ by condition"]

[Opening sentence connecting to aim]

To address [Aim 1], we [brief method reference]. Analysis of [N] samples 
revealed [main finding] (Figure 1A). Specifically, [quantitative details 
with statistics]. [Additional observation from Figure 1B].

<!-- Figure 1 reference block -->
**Figure 1.** [Brief inline reference to caption topic]

## [Heading for Aim 2]

[Continue pattern for each aim/figure group]

---

## Figure Summary

| Figure | Caption File | Referenced in Section |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| Fig 1 | ✓ | Section 1 |
| Fig 2 | ✓ | Section 2 |

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] All figures referenced in text
- [ ] Statistics match analysis outputs
- [ ] No interpretation (saved for Discussion)
- [ ] Effect sizes included with p-values
```

### 7. Caption Guidelines

Each figure should have a `caption.md`:

```markdown
# Figure 1. [Short declarative title stating main finding]

**Panel descriptions:**
- **(A)** [What panel A shows, including axis labels]
- **(B)** [What panel B shows]

**Details:**
[Sample sizes, statistical annotations, error bar definitions, 
color/symbol meanings]

**Key finding:**
[One sentence summary of what this figure demonstrates]
```

**Caption example:**
```markdown
# Figure 1. Random forest outperforms logistic regression for protein classification

**(A)** ROC curves comparing classification performance. Random forest 
(blue, AUC = 0.92) showed superior discrimination compared to logistic 
regression (orange, AUC = 0.78). **(B)** Feature importance rankings 
from the random forest model. The top 10 features are shown with their 
mean decrease in accuracy (±SD from 100 bootstrap iterations).

n = 150 samples (75 per class). Error bands in (A) represent 95% 
confidence intervals from 5-fold cross-validation. Asterisks in (B) 
indicate features also significant in univariate analysis (*p < 0.05).
```

### 8. Results vs Discussion

| Belongs in Results | Belongs in Discussion |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| "Expression increased 2-fold" | "This increase suggests..." |
| "Groups differed (p < 0.01)" | "This difference may reflect..." |
| "Model accuracy was 87%" | "This performance compares favorably to..." |
| "We observed correlation (r=0.7)" | "This relationship supports the hypothesis..." |

### 9. Post-Draft Workflow

```
Results draft created. Next steps:

A) Review and verify statistics
   Compare numbers against analysis outputs

B) Refine figure captions
   Ensure captions and text complement (not duplicate)

C) Proceed to /write_discussion
   Use these findings as basis for interpretation

D) Run /next for other suggestions

Any figures missing captions?
⚠️ manuscript/figures/fig3/ has no caption.md
```

## Related Commands

- `/write_discussion` - Interpret these results (coming soon)
- `/write_methods` - Ensure methods match
- `/review_script` - Verify analysis code
- `/next` - Get next suggestions

## Notes

- Results tell WHAT you found, Discussion tells WHY it matters
- Every figure should be referenced at least once
- Numbers in text must match numbers in figures exactly
- Lead with findings, not methods
