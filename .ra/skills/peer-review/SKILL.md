# Scientific Peer Review

> Rigorously evaluate scientific work for quality, validity, and reproducibility.

## When to Use

- Self-reviewing manuscript before submission (REVIEW phase)
- Evaluating methodology and experimental design
- Checking statistical analyses and reporting
- Assessing reproducibility and data availability
- Reviewing others' manuscripts for journals
- Evaluating grant proposals
- Quality checking your own work during ANALYSIS phase

## Review Workflow

```
1. INITIAL SCAN      → Overall impression, scope, significance
2. SECTION REVIEW    → Detailed evaluation of each section
3. METHODOLOGY       → Rigor, assumptions, controls
4. STATISTICS        → Appropriate tests, effect sizes, reporting
5. REPRODUCIBILITY   → Data, code, materials availability
6. FIGURES/TABLES    → Clarity, integrity, accessibility
7. ETHICS            → Approvals, consent, conflicts
8. WRITING           → Clarity, organization, accuracy
9. SYNTHESIZE        → Major/minor issues, recommendation
```

## Stage 1: Initial Assessment

### Quick Questions (5 minutes)

1. **What is the central research question?**
2. **What are the main findings?**
3. **Is the work scientifically sound?**
4. **Are there any immediate major flaws?**
5. **Is it appropriate for the intended venue?**

### Initial Summary Template

```markdown
## Initial Assessment

**Research Question**: [One sentence summary]

**Main Findings**: [2-3 key results]

**Initial Impression**: [Sound/Concerning/Major issues]

**Significance**: [Novel contribution to field?]
```
