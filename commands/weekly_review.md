## Weekly Review Template (Minimal)

For quick reviews:

```markdown
# Weekly Review: [DATE]

**Top 3 accomplishments:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Biggest challenge:**


**Next week's focus:**


**Blockers:**
- None / [List]

---
*5-min review completed*
```

## Patterns to Watch For

### Warning Signs
Flag if detected:
- No commits in >7 days
- Same blocker appearing multiple weeks
- Phase not progressing
- Declining focus scores
- Growing task backlog
- **Motivation decline**: Reduced engagement, avoidance behaviors, dreading project work
- **Scope creep**: Project expanding without planned adjustment

### Recovery Strategies (When Off-Track)

If warning signs are present:

1. **Stop and assess** - Don't just push harder; pause to understand
2. **Identify root cause** - Is it technical, motivational, unclear direction, or external?
3. **Adjust scope/timeline** - Be realistic, not optimistic
4. **Communicate** - Tell collaborators, PI, or stakeholders early
5. **Document the decision** - Write down what changed and why
6. **Set clear checkpoints** - Define how you'll know if recovery is working

```markdown
## Recovery Plan (if needed)

**Issue identified**: [What's wrong]
**Root cause**: [Why it happened]
**Corrective action**: [What will change]
**Check-in date**: [When to reassess]
```

### Positive Patterns
Celebrate:
- Consistent commits
- Phase progression
- Blockers resolved
