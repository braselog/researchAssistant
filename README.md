# Research Assistant Template

> A cloneable project template that transforms VS Code + GitHub Copilot into a domain-specific Research Assistant (RA) for computational researchers.

## What Is This?

This is not a standalone tool or extension. It's a **project template** containing context files, slash commands, and configuration that guide VS Code's GitHub Copilot to behave as a specialized research assistant.

Clone this template for each new research project. The RA will:
- Guide you through research phases (planning → development → analysis → writing)
- Help write manuscript sections from your actual code and data
- Ensure reproducibility through proper documentation and DVC pipelines
- Track tasks and action items from meetings
- Conduct regular reviews to keep you on track

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/[username]/research-assistant-template my-new-project
cd my-new-project

# Remove template's git history
rm -rf .git
git init

# Open in VS Code
code .
```

Then open GitHub Copilot Chat and type:
```
/next
```

The RA will guide you through setup.

## Core Philosophy

**"Feed the Beast"** - The RA is only as good as the context you give it.

This template provides:
- **Context files** that tell the RA about your project and preferences
- **Slash commands** that define specific workflows
- **Templates** for manuscript sections, figure captions, and reviews
- **Phase gates** that prevent skipping critical reproducibility steps

## Key Features

### 🎯 Phase-Based Guidance
Projects progress through: SETUP → PLANNING → DEVELOPMENT → ANALYSIS → WRITING → REVIEW

The RA tracks where you are and won't let you skip critical steps.

### 📝 Manuscript Integration
Write your methods section as you code. Generate results from figures. Draft background from literature reviews.

### 🔍 Literature Research
Deep research with verified citations. No hallucinated references.

### 📋 Task Management
Extract action items from meeting transcripts. Route to tasks.md or GitHub Issues based on complexity.

### 📊 Regular Reviews
Weekly project check-ins. Monthly alignment checks. Quarterly mission reviews.

## Two-Tier Context

**User-level** (`~/.researchAssistant/`):
- `researcher_telos.md` - Your preferences, productivity patterns, strengths
- Persists across all projects
- Set up once, used everywhere

**Project-level** (`.research/`):
- `project_telos.md` - This project's aims, phase, goals
- `phase_checklist.md` - Progress through research phases
- Specific to each project

## Privacy

Sensitive data can be placed in `data/.sensitive/`. This directory is:
- Listed in `.copilotignore` - AI cannot read these files
- Listed in `.gitignore` - Files are not committed

## Requirements

- VS Code with GitHub Copilot enabled
- Python 3.10+ (or R, if preferred)
- DVC for pipeline management
- Git for version control

## Contributing
